# Description

ArduAgent is an SNMP v1/v2c agent for Arduino based loosely on agentuino by Eric C. Gionet.

This implementation makes improvements on the agentuino code, such that it supports the Arduino DUE (An ARM based device) unlike agentuino.

It supports SNMP GET and SET for integers and octet streams (strings) read-write permissions, and most standard error codes.
